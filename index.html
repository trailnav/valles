		<div>First spotted by probes in the early 1970s, the Valles Marineris Abyss has intrigued science for almost 50 years. Many theories
have been put forward to explain its origin. Some have proposed the Great Canyons formed by water erosion, whilst others have suggested tectonic splits in the crust, or a 
Rift Valley as the cause. 

But in 2016 several independent research teams solved one of the long-standing puzzles of Mars - how its two moons, Phobos and Deimos, formed. This is the story of these new insights and how they alter our view of the Red Planet leading to a bold new formation theory for the Canyons
